# Exercise Day 14
countries = ['Estonia', 'Finland', 'Sweden', 'Denmark', 'Norway', 'Iceland']
names = ['Asabeneh', 'Lidiya', 'Ermias', 'Abraham']
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Exercise Level 1
# 1. Explain the difference between map, filter, and reduce.
# 2. Explain the difference between higher order function, closure and decorator
# 3. Define a call function before map, filter or reduce, see examples.
# 4. Use for loop to print each country in the countries list.
# 5. Use for to print each name in the names list.
# 6. Use for to print each number in the numbers list.


# Exercise Level 2
# 1. Use map to create a new list by changing each country to uppercase in the countries list
# 2. Use map to create a new list by changing each number to its square in the numbers list
# 3. Use map to change each name to uppercase in the names list
# 4. Use filter to filter out countries containing 'land'.
# 5. Use filter to filter out countries having exactly six characters.
# 6. Use filter to filter out countries containing six letters and more in the country list.
# 7. Use filter to filter out countries starting with an 'E'
# 8. Chain two or more list iterators (eg. arr.map(callback).filter(callback).reduce(callback))
# 9. Declare a function called get_string_lists which takes a list as a parameter and then returns a list containing only string items.
# 10. Use reduce to sum all the numbers in the numbers list.
# 11. Use reduce to concatenate all the countries and to produce this sentence: Estonia, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Iceland are north European countries
# 12. Declare a function called categorize_countries that returns a list of countries with some common pattern (you can find the countries list in this repository as countries.js(eg 'land', 'ia', 'island', 'stan')).
# 13. Create a function returning a dictionary, where keys stand for starting letters of countries and values are the number of country names starting with that letter.
# 14. Declare a get_first_ten_countries function - it returns a list of first ten countries from the countries.js list in the data folder.
# 15. Declare a get_last_ten_countries function that returns the last ten countries in the countries list.


# Exercise Level 3
# 1. Use the countries_data.py (https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python/blob/master/data/countries-data.py) file and follow the tasks below:
# - Sort countries by name, by capital, by population
# - Sort out the ten most spoken languages by location.
