# TUPLES
"""
A tuple is a collection of different data types which is ordered and unchangeable(immutable).
Tuples are written with round brackets (). Once a tuple is created, we cannot change its values.
We cannot use add, insert, remove methods in a tuple because it is not modifiable(mutable).
Unlike list, tuple has few methods.
- tuple(): to create an empty tuple
- count(): to count the number of a specified item in a tuple
- index(): to find the index of a specified item in a tuple
- operator(): to join two or more tuples and create a new tuple
